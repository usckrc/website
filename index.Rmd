**USC Kidney Research Center (KRC) Bioinformatics** is a dedicated resource designed to empower researchers, clinicians, and students with cutting-edge tools and knowledge in omics and computational biology. As the complexity of kidney disease research continues to expand, the page serves as a centralized hub for sharing curated datasets, analytical pipelines, and educational materials focused on bioinformatics applications in nephrology. By fostering collaboration and innovation, the USC KRC Bioinformatics initiative aims to bridge the gap between raw data and actionable insights, accelerating discoveries that improve patient outcomes and deepen our understanding of kidney health and disease.
