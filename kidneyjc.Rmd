# About

Join us at the **USC Kidney Research Center** for our new Journal Club on Kidney Disease! This interactive forum brings together researchers, clinicians, and students for in-depth discussions on the latest advancements in kidney research. Each quarter, we will explore a new theme through a curated selection of high-impact articles, fostering a collaborative environment for knowledge exchange and critical analysis. Open to all interested in the forefront of kidney disease research and innovations. Donâ€™t miss this opportunity to engage with colleagues and deepen your understanding of the complex science behind kidney health and disease.

**Organizers**: Jonathan Nelson (jnelson4@usc.edu) and Alicia McDonough (mcdonoug@usc.edu)
